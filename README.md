# Mastermind Game

Mastermind Game is an online game that is played "against" the computer. The user can select a level of difficulty from easy, medium and hard. In easy mode the user has 10 attempts to guess a pattern of 4 numbrs that is generated randomly of numbers ranging from 0 to 7 (duplicate numbers are allowed). When 3 guesses are left hints are enable and the user can click after every number submitions to show the numbers they guessed correctly. In medium mode the user has 10 attemps to guess a a pattern of 6 numbrs that is generated randomly of numbers ranging from 0 to 6 (duplicate numbers are allowed). When 5 guesses are left hints are enable and the user can click after every number submitions to show the numbers they guessed correctly. In hard mode the user has 10 attemps to guess a a pattern of 6 numbrs that is generated randomly of numbers ranging from 0 to 8 (duplicate numbers are allowed). When 6 guesses are left hints are enable and the user can click after every number submitions to show the numbers they guessed correctly. For all of these levels at the end of each guess the user receives feedback based on the guess. The feedback lets the user know if they guessed the combination correctly, a number was guessed, and/or they guessed a number in the correct location or if none of the numbers are correct.
