# Mastermind Game

Mastermind Game is an online game that is played "against" the computer. The user can try to guess only 10 attempts of a 4 number combination. At the end of each guess the user receives feedback based on the guess. The feedback lets the user know if they guessed correctly, a number was guessed, and/or they guessed a number in the correct location.
